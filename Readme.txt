Looking at a tutorial for pycrypto, I decided I wanted the code to be able to type the desired numbers (int) to encrypt instead of the default key. 

Using a read and write function, the code can also read and write out a file. The origional, decrypted code is in a default set (temp.txt) file. 

If the file cannot be found, the try function will fail and it will switch to regular string encryption.
